# Myst-Laboratories

Myst-Laboratories is a creative innovation studio dedicated to learning, experimenting, and building. We explore new technologies, develop unique projects, and push the boundaries of what’s possible—whether in game development, software engineering, or beyond. Our flagship game, Mystara, is a 2D platform fighter that blends fast-paced combat with rich lore, but our passion extends to creating, discovering, and mastering new skills. At Myst-Laboratories, we embrace curiosity and innovation, turning ideas into reality.
